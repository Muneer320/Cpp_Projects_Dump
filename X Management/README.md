A simple general purpose `Management System` script. Lately there have been a lot of these School Management System, Hostel Management System, Store Management System, Hospital Management System... and a million more each doing the same thing, so I made this `General Purpose Management System`, here you just need to update a few  initial config variables as per your requirements and your script is ready.
